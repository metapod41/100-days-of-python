# 🔐 Caesar Cipher – Python Encryption Tool

A simple Python-based encryption and decryption program using the classic Caesar Cipher technique.

This project allows users to encode and decode messages by shifting letters of the alphabet by a given number.

## 🛠 Features

* Encode messages (encryption)
* Decode messages (decryption)
* Preserves spaces and special characters
* Handles large shift values using modulo logic
* Interactive loop for multiple operations

---



## 🧠 How It Works

The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the message by a fixed number (shift value).

Example:

```
Message: hello
Shift: 3
Output: khoor
```

Decryption reverses the shift.
